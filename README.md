this is a dumb website based on a scratch game i made forever ago when i was like 9 (its the same thing but with worse art and no shop)

when i started this i was on a mission to figure out html, css, and javascript all in a day. that didnt really work out.
ive used other languages (not a lot though) and this one is weeird so ive been pestering my friends to help me out with it or give me moral support

huge thanks to baglman for helping me make this and Dmoni for tolerating me while i ranted on about all this coding stuff 

anyway i hope you have fun playing this silly little game, it took me forever ðŸ˜­
